## 📖 About

**StorySVG** is a web-based platform that automatically converts text descriptions into professional-quality animated SVG graphics using GPT-4.1. Created as my graduate thesis project, it democratizes animation creation by eliminating the need for coding or design expertise.

**Author:** Irfani Suar (蘇苡凡)  
**Supervisor:** Professor 王佳盈  
**Institution:** Chung Yuan Christian University

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎨 **Text-to-Animation**: Write a story, get an animated SVG
- 🤖 **AI-Powered**: GPT-4.1 understands context and creates coherent visuals
- 🎯 **Zero Configuration**: No technical knowledge required
- ⚡ **Fast Generation**: ~3.8 minutes average
- 📱 **Cross-Platform**: Works on all modern browsers
- 🎭 **Multiple Modes**: Single scenes or complete multi-scene narratives

---

## 🚀 How It Works

```
1. Enter Story Text → 2. AI Processing → 3. Instant Preview → 4. Download & Share
```

The platform uses intelligent prompt engineering to generate animations that include:
- Character designs and movements
- Scene settings and backgrounds
- Smooth transitions and effects
- Thematic color progressions
- Professional typography
